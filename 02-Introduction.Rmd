# Introduction
Each chapter of the book is composed of the following three aspects:
  - An important topic or question in translational bioinformatics
  - An example of publicly available data (if data is not available publicly, only the methodologies will be described)
  - R code utilizing advanced statistics, machine learning and/or causal inference methods 

## Topics
The following topics will be covered:
1. Predictive biomarker identification using interpretative machine learning approach.
2. Prognostic predictions using Bayesian statistics. 
3. Benchmarking survival predictions using statistics and machine learning.
4. Subgroup identification using causal discovery and counterfactual modeling.
5. Apply estimand thinking in answering exploratory biomarker questions.


## Data
The datasets used are listed below:
1. Depmap data
2. Diabetes data
3.
